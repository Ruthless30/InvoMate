## 📂 Getting Started

### Build & Run
📌 First-Time Configuration (Windows)
When the application is run for the first time on Windows, it will automatically generate:

📁 Database file:
C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\

⚙️ Configuration file:
C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\Project\config.properties

These files store your company name, phone number, and local client/product data.

🛠️ Customization & Migration
To change your company name or phone number, edit the config.properties file.

To move your data to another computer, copy both the database file and the config file to the same paths on the new machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ruthless30/InvoMate.git
cd InvoMate
mvn clean package
java -jar target/InvoMate.jar
